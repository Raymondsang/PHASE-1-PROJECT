# PHASE-1-PROJECT
The project is about a website that provides guidelines on how to do laboratory work and maintain biosafety and prevent hramful microorganisms from leaving the lab.
It contains information on different sources and makes them available to the user at a centralized place.                                                           
With updates and new information constantly coming out,it makes the information available to the users in good time.
the website also has a table where users can record their activities and daily work. This helps with accountability and reduce liability incase of accidents or other occurences.
The website has a login feature so that the admin can be able to track user activities.
usernames and passwords stored in the db.json file can be accesseg using the .find feature to validate users.
IN simple terms, my website is a simple tool where researchers can easily get access to the latest literature and SOP files of various laboratory protocols. This is especially important with the rise of use of Web3 for decentralized science.
